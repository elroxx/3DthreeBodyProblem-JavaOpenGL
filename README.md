# Three Body Simulation

This is a 3D simulation of the famous three body problem. This was made from scrap in Java with OOP principles and the Java OpenGL (JOGL) bindings of C++ OpenGL library.

This was made together with Elie Audette and Khaled Dlimi as our final CEGEP project. We were required to create an application combining our knowledge of the sciences we studied (in this case, physics and computer science).

The main frame was required to be in JavaFX (so 2D). To push ourselves, we decided to utilize this opportunity and deepen our knowledge of low level graphical programming. Thus, we created this 3D simulation which is embedded into a JavaFX Frame.
